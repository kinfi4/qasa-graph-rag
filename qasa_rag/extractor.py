EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """You are a Knowledge Graph Specialist. Extract named entities and relationships from the text.

## Entity Types (ONLY extract these)
- PERSON: Individuals with proper names (e.g., "Albert Einstein", "Marie Curie")
- ORGANIZATION: Companies, institutions, teams, bands (e.g., "NASA", "The Beatles")
- LOCATION: Geographic places with proper names (e.g., "Tokyo", "Mount Everest")
- EVENT: Named events, wars, competitions (e.g., "World War II", "2008 Summer Olympics")
- WORK: Creative works, publications, products (e.g., "Harry Potter", "The New York Times")

## DO NOT Extract
- Pronouns or references: he, she, they, it, this, that, the former, the latter
- Generic terms: the company, the author, a person, the team, the city
- Partial dates: '47, the 90s, last year (only named dates like "March 2020")
- Bare numbers: 100, 37 (unless part of a name like "Apollo 11")
- Common nouns without proper names: city, country, book, song, album, film
- Adjectives or descriptors: famous, large, important, American

## Critical Rules
- Use the FULL proper name: "Albert Einstein" not "Einstein", "United States" not "US"
- Use third person: name the subject explicitly, never use pronouns
- Each triple MUST reference entities from the entities list
- Input format is: first line = document title (**title**), next lines = paragraph text - consider both when extracting
- You MUST consider BOTH title and paragraph text when extracting entities, relations, and descriptions
- Consider the FULL text when writing descriptions

## Example
Text: "Einstein developed relativity while at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern."
Entities:
- Albert Einstein | PERSON | Physicist who developed the theory of relativity
- Swiss Patent Office | ORGANIZATION | Government office where Einstein worked
- Bern | LOCATION | Swiss city where the Patent Office is located

Triples:
- (Albert Einstein, worked at, Swiss Patent Office)
- (Swiss Patent Office, located in, Bern)
